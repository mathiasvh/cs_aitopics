   abstract = {
      This project carries out a comprehensive study of how machine 
      learning methods can be applied to automate the task of 
      regression. An empirical analysis of the performance of a set 
      of regression models on a large collection of regression 
      datasets was carried out. This analysis was used to visualise 
      the space of regression datasets and models, from which rich 
      structure was revealed to further general understanding of the 
      performance of regression models across diverse datasets.The 
      problem of meta machine learning was introduced in which 
      machine learning methods for regression were used to learn a 
      model for the performance of other regression methods. We 
      explore a number of different features for this task and 
      investigate their impact on overall performance.  Numerous meta 
      machine learning models were trained and integrated into 
      several automated systems for regression. We investigate and 
      report on the ability of these systems to automatically achieve 
      high regression performance while minimising time incurred for 
      the regression analysis.
